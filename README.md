# Simple Python Program

## Overview
This Python script demonstrates basic input/output operations, type conversions, and simple arithmetic calculations. It interacts with the user to collect their name, age, and a product's price, then performs calculations based on the input.

## Features
- Greets the user by their name.
- Asks the user for their age and calculates their age in the next year.
- Accepts a price input and calculates the after-tax price (assuming a tax rate of 10%).

## Code Explanation
```python
name = input("Name: ")
print("Hello", name)

print("give me a number: ")
test = input()

age = input("Age: ")
print("You are", age, "years old")

age_num = int(age)
next_year = age_num + 1
print("Next year you will be", next_year)

price = float(input("Price: "))
after_tax = price * 1.1
print("After taxes:", after_tax)
```

### Step-by-Step Functionality
1. **Greeting the User:**
   - Prompts the user to enter their name.
   - Prints a personalized greeting.

2. **Handling Age Input:**
   - Prompts the user to input their age.
   - Calculates and displays their age in the following year.

3. **Handling Price Input:**
   - Prompts the user to input the price of a product.
   - Calculates the after-tax price by multiplying the price by `1.1` (assuming a 10% tax rate).

### Key Variables
- `name`: Stores the user’s name.
- `test`: Placeholder variable for additional input.
- `age`: The user’s age as a string.
- `age_num`: The user’s age converted to an integer.
- `next_year`: The user’s age in the following year.
- `price`: The input price of a product.
- `after_tax`: The calculated price after applying a 10% tax.

## How to Run
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Steps
1. Save the script as `simple_program.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the script’s directory.
4. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python simple_program.py
   ```
5. Follow the prompts and input the required values.

## Example Interaction
```
Name: Alice
Hello Alice
give me a number: 
5
Age: 30
You are 30 years old
Next year you will be 31
Price: 100
After taxes: 110.0
```
